# Reading-notes-on-RLHF-theory

This repo keeps my personal reading notes on following topics:

* RLHF/LLM-related theory
* RL theory/algorithm
* Learning notes on statistics


Please note that personal notes may contain errors or omissions â€” do not blindly trust. If you find any issues in my notes, you are welcome to point them out in the issues.

Academic discussions or collaborations are also very welcome.
